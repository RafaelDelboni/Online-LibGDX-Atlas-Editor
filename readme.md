### Development
Want to contribute?  
I've made this for my own use, and I didn't care about layout and some Atlas functionalities that I wasn't using.  
If you see something you can add, change, improve some existing functionality or anything, would be great.


### Todos
 - Layout
 - Add a Atlas Header editor
 - Add more sprite info in editor
 - Add more file export layouts
